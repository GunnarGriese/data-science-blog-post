## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

gcloud sdk [!gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)

## Project Motivation

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose the Google Analytics Merchandise Store dataset.

As a digital analytics enthusiast, it would be quite interesting to apply my data analysis skills here.

My key interests would be:

1. What percentage of users is actually buying and what is there average spend?
2. How are users and revenue distributed geographically?
3. Can a user's revenue be predicted taking into account his previous user journey?

## File Descriptions

data.csv contains clickstream data on a session level including device, country, landing page, time on site etc.
There is also a notebook available here to showcase the work related to my three questions.

## Results

The main findings of the analysis can be found in this [!medium blog post](https://medium.com/p/7207ca8d865/edit)

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgments
